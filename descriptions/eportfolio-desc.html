<p><b>Problem:</b> I was unsatisfied with how little information recruiters could gather about me by simply reading my resume. I also wanted to increase my professional web presence to make it easier for recruiters to find and contact me.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> In the end, I reasoned that developing my own e-portfolio website would be a great way for recruiters to learn more about my skills and work experience.</p>
<p><b>Process:</b> Beginning this project, I hardly knew anything about web development. I knew the very basics of HTML and the syntax of JavaScript, due to my familiarity with Java. I had heard of CSS, but had never tried to learn it. So, I started from scratch. I spent a few weeks getting familiar with the languages I would need to use.</p>
<p>I carefully laid out a paper prototype of how I wanted my website to look. Then, I tried my best to replicate my prototype using HTML and CSS. I went through each page and carefully crafted the code to match the design of my prototype, learning a lot along the way. Slowly, it all came together.</p>
<p><b>Final thoughts:</b> Now that my website is complete, I can look back at my progress and feel proud of what I created. Through this project, I feel a lot more confident in my web development ability.</p>
